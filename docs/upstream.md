# Upstream workarounds

The register of what egui-pop compensates for in its dependencies. Each
entry says what is compensated, where it is tracked upstream, how
egui-pop works around it (the code site carries an `// upstream:`
comment pointing here) and when the workaround can go.

Reviewed at every egui bump: remove what upstream fixed, update the rest.

## egui_kittest: no double click from queued events

- **Compensated**: a double click made of queued events never registers,
  because each queued event advances the clock by `step_dt` (0.25 s),
  beyond egui's 0.3 s double-click delay.
- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/8697>
- **Workaround**: `egui_pop_test::double_click(harness, label)` (and
  `double_click_at`) put the four button events in one frame, so egui
  sees both clicks within its delay instead of `step_dt` apart.
- **Remove when**: kittest ships a `double_click` helper or a per-step
  time.

## egui_dock: no per-tab, per-destination drop veto

- **Compensated**: egui_dock has no hook to refuse dropping a given tab
  in a given place (only `allowed_in_windows` and the global
  `AllowedSplits`), while egui-pop panels declare the areas they may live
  in.
- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/anhosh/egui_dock/issues/351> (related
  to #163 there).
- **Workaround** (for the future workbench): validate the layout after a
  drop and move the tab back to an allowed area, with a warning naming
  the panel and the area (no silent no-op, ADR 0003). The model side
  already exists: `Layout::repair` moves panels found in an area they may
  not be in.
- **Remove when**: the hook lands in egui_dock.

## egui: symbols missing from the default fonts

- **Compensated**: symbols such as ✓ ▸ ◆ ● render as missing glyphs with
  egui's default fonts.
- **Upstream**: fixed by <https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/8491>
  ("Render any glyph on native", merged, expected in egui 0.37).
- **Workaround**: icons are named by role (`egui_pop_core::icon::Icon`)
  and drawn from the Phosphor icon font (`phosphor` feature), installed
  in a family of its own, or painted with lines and fills; widgets never
  put symbols in text.
- **Remove when**: egui-pop moves to egui 0.37.
